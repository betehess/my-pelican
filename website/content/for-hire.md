Title: Available for hire
Date: 2015-02-04
Slug: for-hire

Yesterday, the whole engineering team at Pellucid got laid off. **I am now looking for new adventures**.

[My resume is available here on my website](http://bertails.org/resume). Please contact me at <alexandre@bertails.org>.

I am open to relocation (almost) anywhere in the world, especially for interesting projects relying on Scala **and** RDF.


why you should hire me
----------------------

I am a **strong Scala developer** with many years of experience and a good background in Computer Science. I love learning new skills and I get involved in [Open Source projects](https://github.com/betehess), leading [banana-rdf](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf). I frequently give presentations (my next talk is at [Scala Days San Francisco](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-sanfran-2015#eventid-6548) in just a few weeks) and organize conferences ([nescala](http://nescala.org/)).

I am a **Linked Data expert** who worked at the W3C closely with Director Tim Berners-Lee, [inventor of the World Wide Web](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/), and gained a thorough and practical knowledge of HTTP and REST APIs. I am also the editor of two major [Web standards: RDB2RDF Direct Mapping and Linked Data Patch Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/tr-editor-all#tr_Alexandre_Bertails).

Bonus: I have a lovely French accent :-)


what might make a difference
----------------------------

My first interest is in your product and the technologies you use. I am looking for a position where I will bring my expertise to the table but also where I will be challenged.

Then I will look at how you work as a team. I have learned over the years how culture can shape teamwork and I am eager to discuss with you what values and attitudes you encourage and nurture in your workplace.
